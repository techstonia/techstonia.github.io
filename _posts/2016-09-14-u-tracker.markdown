I made a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/u-tracker/ahjdheidpdofgigipopceegadiieldoe" target="_blank">chrome extension</a> for playing poker at Unibet. It's basically a mini HEM/PT3, which shows graphs and stats for cash games and tourneys. For those who don't know what HEM/PT3 is let's just say that it's a software that displays and collects stats and is useful if you play online poker.

How to use?

1. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/u-tracker/ahjdheidpdofgigipopceegadiieldoe" target="_blank">Install the extension</a>
2. log into Unibet and keep the tab open
3. Press the extension button
4. A new tab opens with some stats about your recent poker results

P.S. The extension calculates it's stats from the buy-in and sit-out amounts as Unibet doesn't offer an easy way to use hand-by-hand information

<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/u-tracker/ahjdheidpdofgigipopceegadiieldoe" target="_blank">Get the extension</a>
